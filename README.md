# gcims-curve-harmonization

This repository contains R code and documented workflows related to the harmonization of GC-IMS calibration curves and signal intensities.

The focus of this project is on aligning and scaling calibration curves across different datasets and measurement conditions, in order to enable consistent quantification and comparison of GC-IMS data.
